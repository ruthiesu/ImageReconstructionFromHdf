# Aâ€‘Scan / Câ€‘Scan Ultrasonic Viewer

Ultrasonic inspection generates massive amounts of data across 2D areas. This project simplifies and speeds up visual inspection by:

- Allowing quick comparison between different points
- Enabling image-style exploration of ultrasonic data
- Supporting multiple processing modes (basic vs. smoothed)
- Offering flexible sliders to refine the view instantly

Itâ€™s designed to help researchers and engineers make decisions faster and with more confidence when exploring test results.


## What does this project do?

- Loads ultrasonic scan data from an `.hdf5` file.
- Renders a 2D grayscale amplitude image (C-scan) computed from the signal vector at each point.
- Lets the user hover and click on pixels to view the corresponding A-scan waveform.
- Allows live adjustment of:
  - Sample index range (horizontal signal window)
  - Amplitude window (contrast scaling)
- Supports alternative analysis modes, including neighborhood smoothing.

## Input

The application expects an HDF5 file (`.hdf`, `.h5`, or `.hdf5`) that contains a dataset named `"A-Scans"` with the following specifications:

- Shape: (18130, 625)
- Type: signed 16-bit integers or similar

Internally, the data is reshaped into:

(74 rows, 245 columns, 625 samples per vector)

Each pixel in the amplitude image corresponds to a time-domain waveform (A-scan) at a physical location.

## Output

- A main window with:
  - A grayscale amplitude image (C-scan map)
  - A live hover coordinate display
  - A dropdown to select analysis type
  - A bottom waveform plot that updates on click
- The user can export the amplitude image as a PNG snapshot, with a filename reflecting the selected pixel and analysis parameters.

## Analysis modes

The drop-down menu allows selection of different amplitude analysis modes:

1. Basic:  
   Uses the raw vector at each (x, y) position.

2. Radius 1 average:  
   For each pixel, the A-scan is replaced with the average of its own signal and the signals of its 8 neighbors (a 3Ã—3 box around it). This reduces noise and highlights consistent features.

## Screenshots

### Radius 1 average

In both images, the amplitude image is shown at the top, and the waveform for a selected pixel is shown at the bottom. In the averaged mode, local noise is reduced and broader structures emerge more clearly.

## How to use this project

1. Download  
   Clone or download the repository to your computer.

2. Install dependencies  
   You must have Python 3.7â€“3.11 installed.  
   This project uses the following Python libraries:
   - numpy
   - h5py
   - matplotlib
   - PyQt5

   To install them, open a terminal and run:

   pip install numpy h5py matplotlib PyQt5

3. Run the application  
   Make sure you're inside the folder containing viewer.py, then run:

   python viewer.py

   This will launch the graphical interface.

4. Load a sample file  
   Once the app is open:
   - Go to the File menu â†’ Openâ€¦
   - Choose the included example scan file:
     docs/sample_scan.hdf5

   You can then interact with the image, view waveforms, adjust sliders, change analysis modes, and export PNGs.
